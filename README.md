<hr>

*Note 1: original version (aka. vanilla version / official version): a version that is released in [the original post](https://www.celestialheavens.com/forum/10/16657) by the original author, Rodril, in the form of full package or lightweight patch. It is to be distinguished from the [Community Branch](https://gitlab.com/templayer/mmmerge) version*

*Note 2: hotfix version `2020-08-16fix`, made by Tom Chen, fixes [automatic quest completion and dialogue displacement bugs](https://www.celestialheavens.com/forum/10/16657?start=5880#p382652) that appear in `2020-08-16`, by replacing the buggy `Scripts/Structs/After/RemoveNPCTablesLimits.lua` file with an older version*
